# 📊 Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) on Car Prices Dataset

This repository contains a comprehensive Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) report on a car prices dataset. The objective is to identify key insights and relationships between car attributes and their selling prices using visual and statistical methods.

## 📁 Contents
- `Plots.ipyb` -  Jupyter notebook containing code with visualizations
- `carprices` - Dataset downloded from kaggle 
- `EDA_CarPrices_Report.pdf` – PDF report with visuals and point-wise analysis.
  
## 🧰 Tools & Libraries Used

- `Python`
- `Pandas`
- `Matplotlib`
- `Seaborn`

## 📌 Key Insights

- **Car Age Distribution**: Most cars are relatively new, with the distribution skewed to the right.
- **Selling Price**: Majority of cars fall in a specific price range with a few high-value outliers.
- **Car Model Frequency**: One model dominates in frequency.
- **Mileage vs. Sell Price**: Negative correlation observed.
- **Model vs. Mileage**: Varies by model; some more fuel-efficient than others.
- **Correlation Analysis**: Price has a negative correlation with both age and mileage.

## 🎯 Purpose
This analysis helps in understanding how various factors such as car age, mileage, and model affect the selling price of cars. It is useful for:

- Data Science learners

- Analysts performing EDA

- Car dealerships or price estimation models
